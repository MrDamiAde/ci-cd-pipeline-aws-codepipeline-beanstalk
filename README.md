# CI/CD Pipeline Deployment with AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## Overview

In this project, I set up a CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application using AWS services like Elastic Beanstalk, CodePipeline, and CodeBuild. The goal was to simulate the automation of deploying new versions of an application from a GitHub repository to Elastic Beanstalk with zero downtime.

## What I Did

### 1. **Set Up Elastic Beanstalk Application**
1. I started by creating a Node.js web server environment on Beanstalk

2. I then configured service access to Elastic Beanstalk

3. I selected the default VPC and selected two subnets

4. After a few minutes, my environment is live with a default screen:

### 2. **Created a GitHub Repository**
1. Next, I created a GitHub repository ```devops-lab``` where the source code will be hosted

2. I also created a connection to that repository under Developer Tools called ```my-connection```

### 3. **Set Up CodePipeline**
1. I created a pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, which automatically deploys changes to the Elastic Beanstalk application.
2. Under settings in Developer Tools, I created a connection to my GitHub

### 4. **Finish CodePipeline Set Up**
1. After having the required files, I created a basic pipeline

2. Named it devops-lab and allowed it to create a new service role

4. Selected Github as source provider, selected the connection I created earlier, and chose ```devops-lab``` as the repository

5. I then finally configured the deploy provider as Elastic Beanstalk, chose London as region, and application name
   ![Screenshot 2025-03-29 071351](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e14c34c-898b-4899-8425-91466b5879b0)

6. My pipeline is now created and ready for use. However, because there's no code to deploy, the pipleline errored:

### 5. **Use CloudShell to Manage Files**
1. I used CloudShell to create a new directory called devops-lab, then git cloned my ```devops-lab``` directory into it
2. I then uploaded the nodejs-blue folder into the directory

The difference with this index.html file is that it specifies the background colour to be blue and not green

4. I then pushed this change into my devops-lab directory

### 6. **Tested the Entire Pipeline**
Finally, I pushed changes to the GitHub repository, triggering the pipeline to ensure everything was automated properly.

## Project Completed ðŸŽ‰


- I now have a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that deploys the app from GitHub to Elastic Beanstalk.
- With AWS CodePipeline and CloudShell, I can push changes to GitHub and have them automatically deployed to my app without manual intervention.
- This setup is scalable, and I can easily integrate future updates or add new features to the pipeline.
